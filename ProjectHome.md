Nothing particular, just a collection of various things that I create.

  * [Create-Project](CreateProject.md) Powershell script to set up and create projects (so far .NET only) with one command.

  * OptionalPropertyInjectionFacility is a [Castle Windsor](http://www.castleproject.org/container/index.html) facility for setting policies on which properties are injected.  It has been moved into the [CastleContrib project](http://using.castleproject.org/display/Contrib/Castle.Facilities.OptionalPropertyInjection).

  * [Can't Dance The Lambda](http://gim-projects.googlecode.com/files/CantDanceTheLambda.zip) - Presentation and code-samples on how to use lambdas of all the time and for everything.

  * [log4net.GrowlAppender](http://code.google.com/p/gim-projects/source/browse/log4net.GrowlAppender) - Route your log4net messages to [Growl for Windows](http://www.growlforwindows.com/gfw/) or any other instance of Growl (untested)
